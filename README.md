## ðŸ’» Running the development server

Start the Next.js development server on the default port 3000 with:

```
yarn
```

```
yarn dev
```

> Alternatively, run `yarn dev -p 8080` or any port other than `8080` to start the server in a different port.

Once the server is running, you should see output that looks like this:

```

yarn run v1.22.11
$ next dev
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
info - Using webpack 5. Reason: Enabled by default https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/webpack5
event - compiled successfully

```
